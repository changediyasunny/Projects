{"review": "Gingerbread Stout can stand up to just about anything Hardywood decides to throw at it and seemingly always adds new elements to its ensemble gracefully The regular recipe is delicious and the Brandy Barrel Bourbon Barrel and Coffee versions are all even better This version with both bourbon barrel aging and coffee fusion is also delicious although I think the coffee gets a little lost in the avalanche of flavor It pours coffee/chocolate brown with big tan had The bourbon and gingerbread character are strong on the aroma and very strong on the flavor just like the bourbon barrel aged version of GBS To my palate its also just a notch hotter than the bourbon barrel variant which is odd since its actually about half a tick lower in ABV I expected the coffee to show up in the mix in a big way too and it just doesnt Still when my principle complaint is that it tastes like BBGBS a delicious incredibly well-crafted stout its hard to consider that a complaint Coffee Sure the label says so so I guess its there but I dont taste it All I taste is another delicious Hardywood barrel aged malty masterpiece", "name": "Hardywood Kentucky Christmas Morning", "type_score": {"appearance": 3.0, "palate": 4.0, "taste": 4.0, "aroma": 4.0, "overall": 4.25}}
